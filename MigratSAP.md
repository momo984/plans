As an Azure Solution Architect aiming to migrate SAP on-premises workloads to Azure, you already have a strong foundation in Azure infrastructure and architecture design. To estimate the Azure resources needed for an SAP migration and build essential SAP knowledge, you need to assess the SAP environment, map it to Azure services, and understand SAP applications (e.g., SAP HANA, S/4HANA, NetWeaver, BW/4HANA), their architectures, and components. Leveraging my expertise as an Azure Solution Architect with extensive SAP migration experience, I’ll provide a detailed guide tailored for you, focusing on estimation and foundational SAP knowledge. I’ll also update the résumé section to reflect your expertise, using the same artifact_id as requested.

### Part 1: Estimating Azure Resources for SAP Migration
Estimating Azure resources for SAP migration involves assessing the on-premises SAP environment, sizing resources, and designing an Azure architecture that meets performance, availability, and compliance needs. Below is a structured approach for an Azure Solution Architect.

#### 1. **Assess the On-Premises SAP Environment**
   - **Inventory**:
     - Identify SAP systems (e.g., S/4HANA, NetWeaver, BW/4HANA, ECC).
     - Note versions (e.g., S/4HANA 2023, SAP HANA 2.0 SPS07).
     - Document dependencies (e.g., custom code, third-party integrations).
   - **Workload Requirements**:
     - **Compute**: CPU, memory, and SAP Application Performance Standard (SAPS) for application servers and databases.
     - **Storage**: Database size, log volumes, shared file systems, and backup needs.
     - **Network**: Bandwidth, latency, and hybrid connectivity requirements.
   - **Performance Metrics**:
     - Collect peak usage data (e.g., concurrent users, batch jobs) using SAP transactions (STAD/ST03).
     - Estimate SAPS with SAP Quick Sizer or SAP EarlyWatch reports.
   - **Compliance and Security**:
     - Identify regulatory needs (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
     - Document encryption and access control requirements.
   - **Tools**:
     - **SAP Quick Sizer**: Estimates SAPS, CPU, memory, and storage.
     - **Azure Migrate**: Discovers on-premises VMs and assesses Azure compatibility.
     - **SAP EarlyWatch**: Provides system performance and sizing data.

   **Example**: An S/4HANA system with 1,000 users might require 30,000 SAPS, 256 GB RAM for the database, and 128 GB for application servers.

#### 2. **Map SAP Requirements to Azure Services**
   Select Azure services to match SAP workload needs, ensuring performance, scalability, and high availability. Below are key services and their roles:

   - **Compute**:
     - **Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)**:
       - **M-series VMs** (e.g., M64s, M128s) for SAP HANA, offering high memory (up to 4 TB) and CPU.
       - **E-series** or **D-series** (e.g., E32s_v5, D16s_v5) for application servers and smaller systems.
       - Verify certified VMs in SAP Note 1928533.
     - **VM Scale Sets**: For dynamic scaling of application servers.
     - **Example**: SAP HANA with 2 TB data uses an M128s VM (128 vCPUs, 2 TB RAM).

   - **Storage**:
     - **Azure NetApp Files**: For SAP HANA shared file systems and high-performance storage (low latency, high throughput).
     - **Premium SSD** or **Ultra Disk**: For database data and log volumes (<1 ms latency).
     - **Azure Blob Storage**: For backups, archives, and long-term retention.
     - **Example**: A 2 TB SAP HANA database needs 3 TB Premium SSD (data + logs) and 1 TB Azure NetApp Files.

   - **Networking**:
     - **Virtual Networks (VNets)**: Segment VNets for database, application, and management subnets.
     - **ExpressRoute**: For secure, low-latency hybrid connectivity (e.g., 1–10 Gbps circuit).
     - **Azure Load Balancer**: For high availability of application servers.
     - **Network Security Groups (NSGs)**: To restrict traffic to SAP systems.
     - **Azure Application Gateway**: For web-based SAP interfaces (e.g., Fiori).
     - **Example**: VNet with 4 subnets (10.0.0.0/16 CIDR) and ExpressRoute (2 Gbps).

   - **Database**:
     - **SAP HANA on VMs**: Deploy on certified M-series VMs.
     - **Azure SQL Database**: For non-HANA DBMS like SQL Server (if applicable).
     - **HANA Large Instances**: Bare-metal for very large SAP HANA deployments (>4 TB).
     - **Example**: SAP HANA on an M64s VM for a 1 TB database.

   - **Backup and Recovery**:
     - **Azure Backup**: For VM and database backups with retention policies.
     - **Azure Site Recovery**: For disaster recovery and failover to a secondary region.
     - **Example**: 3 TB backup storage and Site Recovery for 6 VMs.

   - **Monitoring and Management**:
     - **Azure Monitor**: For performance monitoring and alerts.
     - **SAP Enhanced Monitoring Extension**: Integrates with SAP Solution Manager.
     - **Azure Arc**: Manages hybrid SAP systems.
     - **Example**: Log Analytics workspace for 15 VMs (20 GB/day).

   - **Security and Identity**:
     - **Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)**: For authentication and single sign-on.
     - **Azure Key Vault**: For managing encryption keys and secrets.
     - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: For granular access control.
     - **Azure Security Center**: For threat detection and compliance.
     - **Example**: Azure AD for 200 SAP users and Key Vault for database encryption.

   - **Automation**:
     - **Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates** or **Terraform**: For infrastructure as code (IaC).
     - **Azure DevOps**: For CI/CD pipelines in SAP deployments.
     - **SAP Deployment Automation Framework**: Open-source Terraform/Ansible for SAP automation.
     - **Example**: Terraform for provisioning VMs, VNets, and storage.

#### 3. **Estimate Resource Needs**
   Based on the assessment, size Azure resources for a typical SAP S/4HANA system (e.g., 1,000 users, 2 TB database):

   - **Compute**:
     - 1 M128s VM (SAP HANA database, 128 vCPUs, 2 TB RAM).
     - 6 D16s_v5 VMs (application servers, 16 vCPUs, 64 GB RAM each).
   - **Storage**:
     - 3 TB Premium SSD (database data + logs).
     - 1 TB Azure NetApp Files (shared storage).
     - 4 TB Azure Blob Storage (backups).

     - Use **Azure Pricing Calculator** to refine estimates based on region and discounts.

#### 4. **Plan High Availability (HA) and Disaster Recovery (DR)**
   - **HA**:
     - Deploy VMs in **Availability Zones** (if available in the region) or **availability sets**.
     - Configure **SAP HANA System Replication (HSR)** for database HA.
     - Use **Pacemaker clusters** (on Linux) or Windows Server Failover Clustering for application server failover.
     - **Example**: 2 M128s VMs in Availability Zones with HSR for SAP HANA.
   - **DR**:
     - Replicate VMs to a secondary region using **Azure Site Recovery**.
     - Store backups in **Azure Blob Storage** with geo-redundant storage (GRS).
     - **Example**: DR in West US for a primary East US deployment, with 4-hour RTO.

#### 5. **Migration Tools and Process**
